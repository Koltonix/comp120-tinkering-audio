### Blank Unity Project ### 

This repository has been pre-configured with a .gitignore and .gitattributes file specific to Unity projects using git-lfs. 

This project was created for Unity 2018.4.2.f1.

The project has been created with a barebones folder structure and sample assets.  The settings have been optimized for best 3D quality without adding any additional packages to the project.
For 2D projects, go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor and set the "Default Behaviour Mode" to 2D.  Do this at the start so that imported assets are optimized automatically.

Please fork this repository, then rename and clone it to begin working on your project. 

Note:  Do not leave empty folders in your Unity project.  Empty folders do not get added to version control, but the meta files they create do.  This can lead to issues with keeping your project up to date.
